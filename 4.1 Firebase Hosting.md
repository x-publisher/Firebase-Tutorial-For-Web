## Firebase Hosting

Firebase Hosting provides fast and secure static hosting for your web app.


Firebase Hosting is production-grade web content hosting for developers. With Hosting, you can quickly and easily deploy web apps and static content to a global content-delivery network (CDN) with a single command.

### How does it work?
Firebase Hosting is built for the modern web developer. Static sites are more powerful than ever with the rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks like Angular and static generator tools like Jekyll. Whether you are deploying a simple app landing page or a complex Progressive Web App, Hosting gives you the infrastructure, features, and tooling tailored to deploying and managing static websites.

### Getting Started with Firebase Hosting

1. Install Firebase CLI (Command Line Interface) requires Node.js and npm, which can both be installed by following the instructions on https://nodejs.org/. Installing Node.js also installs npm.

    Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the Firebase CLI via npm:

    ```bash
        npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```
    This installs the globally available `firebase` command. To update to the latest version, simply re-run the same command.
    
    
    
2. Initialize your app
    Once you've chosen the Firebase app you'd like to deploy, cd into your project directory and run the command:
    
    ```bash
        firebase init
    ```
    Running the firebase init command creates a `firebase.json` settings file in the root of your project directory. You can learn more         about this file in the Customize Hosting Behavior section of the guide.


3. Add a file
    When you initialize your app, you will be prompted for a directory to use as the public root (default is "public"). If you don't           already have a valid index.html file in your public root directory, one is created for you.


4. Deploy your Website
    Your app will be deployed to the domain `<YOUR-FIREBASE-APP>.firebaseapp.com`
    
    ```bash
        firebase deploy
    ```
    or
    
    ```bash
        firebase serve
    ```
    To test your site locally at localhost:5000.
    
 
 
5. Manage your rollbacks
    From the Hosting panel in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) you can see a full history of your deploys. To     rollback to a previous deploy, hover over its entry in the list, click the overflow menu icon, then click "Rollback".
